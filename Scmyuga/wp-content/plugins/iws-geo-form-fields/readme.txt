Add Country > State > City drop-down in your forms. IWS - Geo Form Fields supports Elementor Pro & Contact form 7 two most popular form builders.

== Description ==

You can use Contact form 7, Elementor Pro, or any add-on for elementor that lets you build your Contact form. IWS - Geo Form Fields will work fine as long as your form builder lets you set 'id' for the input fields.
The field detection of IWS - Geo form fields is developed in such a way that you can use the keywords "country", "state" and "city" with or without any prefix or postfix.
For example, you can type  "iws_country" or "country_iws" or "iwscountry" will work, But notice the core spelling must match.
For example, If you type "states" system matches "state" and treats the last "s" in "state{s}" as postfix and ignores it.

IWS - Geo Form Fields has a list of 
* 250 Countries 
* 4,880 States
* 1,45,000+ Cities

If your location is not covered in this list, you can easily add the location from the Admin panel.

**Coming Soon!**
Support for Gravity form and Ninja form
